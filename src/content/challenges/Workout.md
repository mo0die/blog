For 90 days, I will be using this workout plan. All exercises will be 4 sets: 1 warmup set, 2 working sets, and 1 set to failure.

The thought and reason behind my workout plan:

I am a big fan of compound exercises, all of them but deadlifts. Deadlifts, in my opinion, have a greater risk, and unless you are doing competitive weightlifting, then there is no point, but that's just me.

In addition to my gym routine, I am doing 10k steps a day and running 5km on alternate days. For example:

Monday: Day 1
Tuesday: 5km
Wednesday: Day 2
Thursday: 5km
Friday: Day 3
Saturday: 5km
Sunday: 5-10km

Why this much? Well, the gym is the easiest part, but in order to lose fat, you need to walk 10k steps a day. Running 5km is good for your heart, and everyone should be able to run 5km easily. As you get older (and I see this with a lot of my friends), if they jog for 10 minutes—if they even make it to 10 minutes—they give up and start breathing heavily. I've also seen them go up the stairs and just stop to catch their breath (this was me once upon a time). Don't ever let this happen to you.

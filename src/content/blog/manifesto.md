## INTRO

For the longest time, I wanted to grow an audience on a social platform. In 2019, I managed to grow a YouTube channel from 0 to 500 subs in under 3 months â€” not a lot, but this was done with no promo or posts anywhere, just relying purely on the algorithm.

During that time, good content worked. I posted sample packs 3 times a week for free and made a few connections. This is something I want to get back to eventually, although I don't know when.

_*(Sample packs are music compositions that are used by producers to sample without having to worry about copyright or fear being sued. These samples were made to be sampled and used by producers)*_

## What does that have to do with X?

Well, I believe the same logic still applies today for both X/YouTube. The algorithms for both platforms are really great at showcasing small creators and can allow someone to go from nothing to meeting people who are well established in the community they want to be a part of.

The trick is to find something that you want to do and add your twist to it to match the community.

This twist isn't too hard to find. Look at other creators from different industries and see how they built their community.

To showcase this, I'm going to outline what I plan to do for the next 90 days to run this experiment and see if my theory on providing good value and documenting that journey will build an audience and a personal brand that I can use, as well as establish connections within the community and hopefully be able to provide great value.

## THE PLAN

The plan is fairly simple.

Post for 90 days; after 90 days, buy BMW M2.

Jokes aside,

Here is the plan.

For the longest time, I have had this fitness app idea in my head. I have used Excel sheets to build the algorithm, and it has been my favorite way to track progress. However (comma) I wanted to convert this sheet into a web app and hopefully get paying subscribers. The app can be the best app in the world, but the thing that was holding me back was how to market this app. I'm not a fitness model or a well-established gym bro; I do not have an audience that follows me for fitness. I am unknown, and no one would use it other than me and my friends.

This is where the plan/twist comes in.

Following Tech Twitter for the past few months, I spent time studying it, and everyone seems to be on the same page: AI. This is understandable. However, no one on Tech Twitter seems to show how to stay fit and healthy while working on projects and working full time. You cannot just prompt yourself into fitness this actually needs time.

So how will I do it?

Well, here is the guideline for me to follow day by day and week by week until I hit 90 days:

**The Init:**

1. Get verification on Twitter.

Why is this needed?

Better boost in the algorithm.

**The Day-by-Day:**

1. Post my 10k steps every day.
2. Post workouts.
3. Post 5km/10km runs on Strava and with run clubs.
4. Post my meals every day.
5. Post my progress on the app.
6. Shit post.
7. Reply to as many people as I can and either shit post, provide value, or offer an opinion.

the app will only have an hour limit on my phone to prevent me from wasting too much time

**The Week-by-Week:**

1. Post one vlog-style video that will essentially serve as a weekly stand-up to Twitter; this will also be on YouTube.
   -- essentially a montage of all the work i'm doing and a voice over.

2. Post one blog post on my site.

After 90 days, I aim to hit these goals:

1. 100 Twitter followers.
2. 10-50 subs on YouTube.
3. Lose 25 lbs. (Not hard, I promise I will show everyone how.)
4. A finished product with one user (me).

Why aren't I shooting for crazy numbers? I don't want to set expectations for what I should get. In all honesty, this could end up being thrown into the abyss, or I might create something I never imagined. Believe me, I do want to see these numbers in the thousands (minus the weight), but I'm not setting crazy expectations only to disappoint myself.

Also, if this all doesn't go to plan, at least I'll come out with my app (which I need) and good experiences for me to learn from.

Oh, and one last thing:

Everything I write is not by AI. AI is only used for grammar, spelling, and flow. Thoughts and ideas are all mine.

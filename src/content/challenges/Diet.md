To track my calories, I am using [MacroFactor](https://macrofactorapp.com/macrofactor/).
MacroFactor is a smart nutrition app that personalizes your diet plan based on your metabolism. It helps you track food and adjust your macros for sustainable results. It was created by [Jeff Nippard](https://www.youtube.com/@JeffNippard).

Out of all the apps this has been my favorite calorie tracking app.

The algorithm used by MacroFactor gave me 1987 calories but I'm bumping it up to 2000 calories. I just like even numbers.

Realistically you do not need an app to track your food if you are eating the same meals every day. But for the 90 days I want to document the whole process.

Now the meals are not Michelin-star meals. That's because I want to make meals that take me at most 20 minutes.

Is this ideal and sustainable? Absolutely not. However, once I move back home with my family, I'm getting a private chef to cook meals for me based on my macros.

But this should hold it down until the 90 days are over.

These will be updated once I use the [MacroFactor](https://macrofactorapp.com/macrofactor/) app to calculate the actual food I use and the correct amount of calories.

This will be a guideline. I'm going to try to follow it as much as I can and will try not to be too strict, as I do want to be social and go on dates with my significant other.
All those meals will be tracked.

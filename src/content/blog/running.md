# Why everyone should run

Working a 9-to-5 job that mostly involves sitting, running has been crucial for maintaining a sense of well-being. But another reason I'm running and trying to improve my physical appearance is to avoid falling into a common Middle Eastern trap. It seems like many men in the Middle East, sometime between 25 and 35, get married and their body shape transforms into something resembling a pregnant woman. Their fat goes straight into in their belly, the legs are fine, the arms are fine, the face is somewhat okay, but the belly, MY GOD, that thing is HUGE. I refuse to become that. That's why I run.

Thank you
